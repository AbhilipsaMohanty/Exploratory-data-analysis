### Exploratory Data Analysis of Cardiographic Dataset
This repository contains a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the "cardiographic.csv" dataset. The main goal of this analysis is to uncover insights, identify patterns, and understand the underlying structure of the dataset using statistical summaries, visualizations, and data manipulation techniques.

### Objective
The primary objective of this analysis is to perform a thorough exploration of the "cardiographic.csv" dataset to gain insights into fetal heart rate patterns, uterine contractions, and other related variables. The analysis involves data cleaning, statistical summaries, visualizations, and pattern recognition.

### Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of several variables related to fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring:

1. LB: Baseline Fetal Heart Rate (FHR)
2. AC: Accelerations in FHR
3. FM: Fetal Movements detected by the monitor
4. UC: Uterine Contractions
5. DL: Decelerations Late with respect to uterine contractions
6. DS: Decelerations Short
7. DP: Decelerations Prolonged
8. ASTV: Percentage of Time with Abnormal Short Term Variability in FHR
9. MSTV: Mean Value of Short Term Variability in FHR
10. ALTV: Percentage of Time with Abnormal Long Term Variability in FHR
11. MLTV: Mean Value of Long Term Variability in FHR
### Tools and Libraries
1. Programming Language: Python
2. Data Manipulation Libraries: Pandas, NumPy
3. Data Visualization Libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn

### Tasks and Analysis
#### 1. Data Cleaning and Preparation
1. Loading the Data: Load the dataset into a DataFrame.
2. Handling Missing Values: Impute or delete missing values as necessary.
3. Data Type Correction: Ensure all variables have the correct data types.
4. Outlier Detection: Identify and treat outliers to prevent skewed analysis.
#### 2. Statistical Summary
1. Central Tendency and Dispersion: Provide mean, median, standard deviation, and interquartile range for each variable.
2. Key Findings: Highlight interesting observations from the statistical summary.
#### 3. Data Visualization
1. Distribution Analysis: Create histograms and boxplots to explore the distributions of numerical variables.
2. Categorical Analysis: Use bar charts or pie charts to display frequencies of categorical variables.
3. Relationship Exploration: Generate scatter plots and correlation heatmaps to examine relationships between variables.
4. Advanced Visualization: Utilize pair plots, violin plots, and other advanced techniques for deeper insights.
#### 4. Pattern Recognition and Insights
1. Correlation Analysis: Identify and discuss correlations between variables.
2. Trend Analysis: Explore temporal patterns or trends if the dataset includes time-based data.
#### 5. Conclusion
1. Key Insights: Summarize the main insights and patterns discovered during the analysis.
2. Implications: Discuss how these findings could impact decision-making or guide further analysis.
